### Leaving Feedback // Getting Support
I would be very happy if you could give some feedback on the bot, after you have tried it out. If there're issues with the bot, then you can also reach out to me on my server, [Treeland](https://discord.gg/PvFPEfd).

1.  Extract the code
2.  Install the requirements (requirements.txt)
3.  Copy the configexample.py and rename it to config.py
4.  Fill out the config
5.  Run bot.py, and enjoy
